⚠️ Using a Fidelity Bond is an advanced feature and has many factors to consider. For a thorough guide please read [this](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver/blob/master/docs/fidelity-bonds.md).

Learn how to use Join Market and its general privacy concepts. I highly recommend [@openoms](https://github.com/openoms) guide [here](https://github.com/openoms/bitcoin-tutorials/blob/master/joinmarket/joinmarket_private_flow.md).


### Functionality

Full maker, taker, fidelity bond and direct send features available via the utxo view. 

Tapping the mix button on an existing utxo will trigger a search for any JM servers and wallets.

If you never created a JM wallet with FN you will be prompted to, just follow the prompts.

If you have created JM wallets with FN then you will be prompted to select which one you want to deposit to.

A more comprehensive guide with video tutorial is coming soon.
