## What is this?
This table offers **a comparison of the differences and similarities of FN and FN2**, as far as objectives, features & functionality are concerned.

## Why relevant?
Although the names are very similar, FN and FN2, their objectives are different. FN2 will get another name soon. Anyway, to have a structured overview of the differences and similarities on various topics is far from a *"unnecessary luxury"*.

Both complement each other. The holy grail of bitcoin secure storage is multisig and not having to rely on one app/device/codebase/etc, both are capable of multisig and **can be independent signers for the same multisig wallet**.
